<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Shreyasi Bhaumik. I'm currently learning and exploring the world of tech, and this is my very first small project on GitHub. I'm really excited to start this journey and build up my skills step by step.
  </p>

<p>Right now, I'm focusing on learning and working on improving my coding skills. I believe in learning by doing, so I'm using this space to try out ideas, practice, and grow. I’m also interested in creating clean, meaningful, and useful projects over time.
</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my work — I’m just getting started, and there’s a lot more to come!</p>
